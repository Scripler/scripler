				<div><h2>The insanity of traditional publishing work-flows: The dead of the ubiquitous book-designer</h2></div>
				<br>
				<div class="column">
				The world needs designers, and they are needed everywhere. But in the traditional workflow from manuscript to whatever - there are job-functions that wouldn't be at all necessary if technology and workflows were better designed and fitted together. What we do now is a weird haphazard mix of everything: A workflow essentially hundreds of years old, where the individual elements has been more or less digitalized and evolved hugely with more advanced technology the last couple of decades+.<br><br>
				But the whole process hasn't been redone and rethought completely yet (at least for a great deal of publishers)
				</div>
				<div class="column">
				- something which is sorely needed and will mean great savings and freeing of resources to make better icon - if done right.<br /><br />For example, in many places the text is prepared fully in two places. First made ready as a washed and edited word-manuscript and then again by the designer in InDesign or similar (and even a third time if published digitally). This is insane. There should not be reason to actually produce the text two (or three) times - this is a left-over  from long dead technological paradigmes, representing handwriting (/typewriting) and typesetting.
				</div>
				<div class="column">
				Even so it is done extensively and it runs up the cost of book-production immensely - using our most costly resource - skilled human workforce.<br /><br />Of course everything isn't just cake - it is difficult, costly and easy to make mistakes and fail horribly - and even though iBooks Author has some interesting ideas - it seems to fail to serve anyone but Apple itself - I don't think it will stand in the long run. But things need to change if the publishing business is to survive.

				<h2>The evolution of the book</h2>
				<span>By David Walther Birk</span><br /><br />
				<div class="column">
				With the prophesied coming of the ebook, pundits have been talking about the death of the book for the last 30 years. That’s depressing - let us talk about the evolution of the book instead. This seems to be more appropriate given past experience - the death of the book was probably prophesied back when papyri was invented.<br /><br />
				Talk about the future of the book is often about digitization, either in the form of the changing structures outside and around the book - the distribution, the price and the availability. Or in relation to the packaging - the ebook versus the printed book. What I want to talk about is how the essential bookness of the book might evolve in the years to come.<br /><br />
				I think the real evolutionary pressure on books is created by something that is changing human culture even as these words are written. Some people call this the Internet, some years ago it was called Web 2.0. Here I will coin it the Hyper Networked Usage Phenomenon, or HyNUP for short. Sometimes it takes a freaky name to clearly bring forth the freakish effects of something we interact with everyday.<br /><br />
				The HyNUP has changed human phenomena in explosive and unforeseen ways. But often it is not the phenomena themselves that are special, but just that they are getting Hyper Networked on a global scale. In fact, the most revolutionary internet-phenomena are often super fundamental.
				</div>
				<div class="column">
				Take Facebook - what is more fundamental to human nature than having social ties, family and friends, and sharing things with these people? Or Twitter - real-time tweeting things that are happening. There is a reason it is called Twitter, birds are doing it all time (Watch out #sabretooth). It is basic animal behaviour. Hyper networked - these basic phenomena becomes something new, something wild.<br /><br />
				So what about more complex human phenomena, how does this evolve in a hyper networked context? Take blogs. These are more complex things, closer to our book. Blogs have democratized publishing unlike anything before, giving everyone who wants it a voice and means of using it. Generally blogs concern themselves with shorter concoctions of information.<br /><br />
				What if we increase the complexity even more. Moving beyond blog-length, into the lands of complex literature, structured written knowledge, iterative expositions of science, stories, drama, fiction, poetry - have these phenomena evolved into unknown forms never imagined before? On an explosive culture-changing scale, only Wikipedia comes to mind.<br /><br />
				Ebooks as we know them are variations of known forms, expositions existing in little digital cages. They are as their print counterparts, their packaging different, but dead instances of written text. How are they created? Like afterthoughts to the printed book, involving complex exports and advanced coding.
				</div>
				<div class="column">
				Not to talk about written forms of scientific knowledge, victims of early digitization, lying in their pdf-tombs, locked behind paywalls and institutional bureaucracy.<br />
				My point is that we are not even beginning to see what is possible with this complex human behaviour in a hyper networked context. The ebook scene, or e-publishing, are just mirrors and rehashes of known forms, now in digital.<br /><br />
				But we can try to imagine: What will happen if everyone can write books and publish them worldwide with the blink of an eye? What will happen if a thousand people are reading the end of an amazing story at the same time, commenting and chatting real time in the margins of the book? What will happen if fifty scientists can interact with each other as they are reading a new report on cancer-treatment as it is published? What if ten great screenwriters are going episodical like Dickens, reacting to readers like insane improvisational theater - live literature? I want to know!<br /><br />
				So the idea of Scripler is to see what happens, if we take this human phenomenon, lets call it literature, and grants it power to evolve in a hyper networked context. What will it then become? It’s an evolutionary experiment, with the internet as the laboratory, and the collective literate output of the world as the subject. That is the ambition at least.

				<h1>About</h1>
				
				<div class="column">
					<h2>Do it yourself</h2>
					It’s not easy to change the fundamental structures of a system, that has run the same way for centuries. But that’s the mission Scripler set out to accomplish two years ago. To make publishing possible for everyone. If you want to make an ebook you can. But if you want to have it look and act like it was designed by professionals and you want to make it fast, things start to get complicated. The technologies necessary to DIY exist - but in the current wilderness of self-publishing it’s not accessible to everyone. Existing ebook tools are often extremely pricey and you still need to be familiar with html and css if you want your ebook to be great. That’s where Scripler is different: you’ll be able to create, professionally edit, design, share, and sell your own work - without having to code or shell out thousands of dollars in the process. In fact, it won’t cost you a thing.
				</div>

				<div class="column">
					<h2>From idea to reality</h2>
					All work on Scripler is done with zero pay and after we punch out at our regular jobs. We run solely on sugary bytes and fumes of the digital revolution. Scripler was conceived in the mind of project manager and founder David, who was tired of the exhaustingly rigid ways of old fashioned publishing houses. He asked himself the simple question: Why does it have to be so hard, when it should be so easy? That was two year ago, and since Scripler has grown from a one-man show to a full fledged team of 7 Scriplers. Working with a clear mission for the future: We want you to make great ebooks.<br /><br />
					<a href="#" class="seeteam">See the team</a>
				</div>

				<div class="column">
					<h2>What’s next?</h2>
					In just a few short years the world of ebooks and digital publishing has expanded exponentially and both writers and readers have accepted the paperless book. The digitalization of the written word is teeming with potential - most of which we believe has yet to be realized. With a free and functional publishing tool like Scripler we aim to make the whole process of writing, creating and collaborating more fluid. So instead of having to become a publishing professional, focus on what’s important: creating and sharing.<br /><br />
					Scriplers vision is to make the ebook revolution accessible to anyone who has something to say. If you are one of them, subscribe to our newsletter and get early access when we launch.<br /><br />
