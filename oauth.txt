Normal user-creation:
------------------------
1. User/client sends a request:
    POST /user (username/email/etc send along as post-data)
2. We create the user with the attached data in our database, and let the user be logged in with this new user account.

User-creation through OAuth:
---------------------------
1. User/client sends a request to one of the following:
    GET /auth/twitter (user created using Twitter data)
    GET /auth/google (user created using Google data)
    GET /auth/facebook (user created using Facebook data)
    GET /auth/linkedin (user created using LinkedIn data)
2. User is redirected to the providers page to grant the access
3. Provider redirects the user back to us (callback), with the allowed data attached (e.g. username and email)
4. We create the user with the attached data in our own database, and let the user be logged in with this new user account.
5. (Optoinal) The user is asked to enter any missing data in a form on our site.
